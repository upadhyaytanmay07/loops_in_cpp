# Aim: 
To study and implement C++ decision making statements Loops
# Software Required :
Visual Studio

# Theory:
Different Types of Loops C++ provides three types of loops that works the same, but are preferred in different use cases:

# 1.For Loop:
The for loop is an entry-controlled loop, which means that it checks whether the test condition is true before executing the statements inside it. The various parts of the for loop are:

The for loop in C++ is a control flow statement that allows precise, repeated execution of a code block based on:

Initialization: Where the loop begins

Condition: When it should stop

Increment/Decrement: How it moves forward

Itâ€™s perfect when you know in advance how many times something should happen.

# 2.While Loop:

The while loop is also an entry-controlled loop which is used in situations where we do not know the exact number of iterations of the loop beforehand.

The while loop in C++ is built around the idea of dynamic repetition. It runs a block of code as long as a condition remains true. Unlike a for loop, which is best when the number of iterations is known upfront, the while loop thrives when repetition depends on changing circumstances.

-> Why is it Useful?

1.Ideal for scenarios with unknown end points

2.Great for real-time monitoring, like checking sensor data or waiting for user input

3.Offers flexibility and control over repetition

# 3.Do-While Loop
The do-while loop is an exit-controlled loop which means the condition is checked after executing the body of the loop. So, in a do-while loop, the loop body will execute at least once irrespective of the test condition.

# Infinite Loops:

An infinite loop (sometimes called an endless loop) is a piece of coding that lacks a functional exit so that it repeats indefinitely. An infinite loop occurs when a condition is always evaluated to be true.

# Nesting of Loops:

Nesting of loops refers to placing one loop inside another. The inner loop is executed completely for each iteration of the outer loop. This is useful when you need to perform multiple iterations within each iteration of a larger loop, such as iterating over a two-dimensional array or performing operations that require more than one level of iteration.

Think of nested loops like a clock with seconds and minutes. For every minute that passes (outer loop), 60 seconds tick by (inner loop). In C/C++, a nested loop means you put one loop inside another to do repeated tasks in layers.

-> Basic Idea

1.The outer loop runs first.

2.For each time the outer loop runs, the inner loop runs all its steps.


# Implementation:
The Logic and conditional flow of the statements were seen through the following programs :

1.Printing even numbers from 1 to 10

2.reversing of integer values

3.login through password with lockout mechanism

4.Patterns(Star Patterns, Floyd's series)

5.printing a word multiple times

6.alphabet pattern

# Conclusion:
Through the programs , The logic and operation of loops in C++ has been studied.
